The swiftest horse can't overtake a word once spoken%
Blame yourself as you blame others; forgive others as you
forgive yourself%
"I heard" is good; "I saw" is better%
With virtue you can't be completely poor; without it you
can't be truly rich%
If Heaven made someone
earth can find some use for them%
